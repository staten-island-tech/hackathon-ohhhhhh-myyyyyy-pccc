## 1. **Task/Problem Description**
Why doesn't the module pygame work?
## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**
```python
import pygame
```
I really didn't know what I could do to make import pygame work. I already have it downloaded, so why does it say that there isn't a module named 'pygame'?
## 3. **Interaction with Copilot**
Why doesn't importing pygame into my python code work?
## 4. **Copilot's Suggestions/Code Changes**
```python
pip show pygame
pip install pygame
which python
import pygame
print(pygame.__version__)
```
COPILOT suggested checking to make sure that it was installed. That part might've been pretty useless, but they did give me a source link to a website which told me to run the code in the dedicated terminal instead of the interactive window. 
## 5. **Reflection on Changes**
COPILOT was very helpful in helping me figure out how I could make import python work, despite not telling me how to do so directly.
None of my code needed to be changed; it was just a minor change from running the code in the interactive window to running the code in the dedicated terminal.
## 6. **Testing and Results**
There weren't really any tests to run, and my code did work as intended in the end!
There were no problems after asking copilot.
## 7. **What Did You Learn?**
I learned how to properly install and utilize pygameðŸ˜€.

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**
How do I make a screen display using pygame?
## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**
I took no initial approach, for this is my first time working with pygame and I honestly don't know a single thing about it.
```python
import pygame
print(pygame.__version__)
pygame.init()
```
I really didn't know what I could do to implement a screen display, as I'm not exactly familiar with pygame and what it can do.
## 3. **Interaction with Copilot**
How could one make a screen display in python using pygame?
## 4. **Copilot's Suggestions/Code Changes**
```python
screen_width, screen_height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("lautobus")
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    screen.fill(GREEN)
    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(60)
pygame.quit()
```
## 5. **Reflection on Changes**
COPILOT was very helpful in creating a display screen where I will be able to add my own things in.
## 6. **Testing and Results**
After running the code in the terminal, it worked! There was now a screen display.
## 7. **What Did You Learn?**
I was educated on how pygame can be utilized to create a screen displayðŸ˜€.

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**
How can I make a proper pong game from paddles and a ball?
## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**
First, I knew I needed to actually create the ball and the paddles (along with their properties and dimensions), and to establish what colors I will be using.
```python
pygame.display.set_caption("Pong")
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT = 10, 100
PADDLE_SPEED = 20
BALL_SIZE = 20
ball_speed_x, ball_speed_y = 20, 20
screen.fill(BLACK)
```
I don't know how to make the paddles and ball actually functional because I'm stupid soooooo I'm asking COPILOT.
## 3. **Interaction with Copilot**
From this code, what can be done to make the paddles and ball actually functional for a pong game?
[Insert my code here]
## 4. **Copilot's Suggestions/Code Changes**
Record the code or suggestions Copilot provided. Include any changes or improvements Copilot suggested and how it influenced your approach.
```python
pygame.display.set_caption("Pong")
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT = 10, 100
PADDLE_SPEED = 20
BALL_SIZE = 20
ball_speed_x, ball_speed_y = 20, 20
paddle1 = pygame.Rect(50, HEIGHT // 2 - PADDLE_HEIGHT // 2, PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT)
paddle2 = pygame.Rect(WIDTH - 50 - PADDLE_WIDTH, HEIGHT // 2 - PADDLE_HEIGHT // 2, PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT)
ball = pygame.Rect(WIDTH // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2, HEIGHT // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2, BALL_SIZE, BALL_SIZE)
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_w] and paddle1.top > 0:
        paddle1.y -= PADDLE_SPEED
    if keys[pygame.K_s] and paddle1.bottom < HEIGHT:
        paddle1.y += PADDLE_SPEED
    if keys[pygame.K_UP] and paddle2.top > 0:
        paddle2.y -= PADDLE_SPEED
    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN] and paddle2.bottom < HEIGHT:
        paddle2.y += PADDLE_SPEED
    ball.x += ball_speed_x
    ball.y += ball_speed_y
    if ball.top <= 0 or ball.bottom >= HEIGHT:
        ball_speed_y *= -1
    if ball.left <= 0 or ball.right >= WIDTH:
        ball_speed_x *= -1
    if ball.colliderect(paddle1) or ball.colliderect(paddle2):
        ball_speed_x *= -1
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, paddle1)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, paddle2)
    pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, WHITE, ball)
    pygame.draw.aaline(screen, WHITE, (WIDTH // 2, 0), (WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(60)
```
## 5. **Reflection on Changes**
COPILOT kept the code I created for the paddles and ball, but added code that would allow the paddles and ball to actually move.
## 6. **Testing and Results**
After running the code in the terminal, it worked! They balls and paddle were fully functional and worked as intended.
## 7. **What Did You Learn?**
I gained new insights regarding how you can actually draw shapes using pygame.
